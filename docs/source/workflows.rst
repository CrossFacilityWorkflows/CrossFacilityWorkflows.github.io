Workflow Tools
===============

Supporting data-centric science involves the movement of data, multi-stage processing, and visualization at scales where manual control becomes prohibitive and automation is needed. Workflow technologies can improve the productivity and efficiency of data-centric science by orchestrating and automating these steps.

This page describes approaches available for running workflows within and between computing sites.

ALCF
~~~~

Commonly-used workflows tools at ALCF include `Parsl <https://parsl-project.org/>`_, `Balsam <https://balsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and `Swift <http://swift-lang.org/main/>`_. Workflow technology is rapidly evolving, as project teams consider how to best run jobs that combine simulation and AI, campaigns of thousands to millions of jobs, or workloads with diverse parallelism. Projects often invent their own approach to workflows, or have integrated with other workflow toolkits; ALCF welcomes these approaches and aims to work with users to achieve simple, efficient workflow solutions for users.

NERSC
~~~~~

At NERSC a working group reviews and tests workflow tools to provide documentation for NERSC users. If possible, these doc pages are created collaboratively with the respective workflow tool developers to provide expertise from both worlds. The docs are updated with new information when new tools are evaluated. An overview of all reviewed workflow tools is given `here <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/workflow-tools/>`_. If users are unsure which workflow tool fits their workflow best, they are encouraged to get in touch with NERSC consultants.

Information about workflow tools that are officially supported at OLCF is
available `here <https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/software/workflows/index.html>`_.
